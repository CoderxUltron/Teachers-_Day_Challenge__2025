# Teachers-_Day_Challenge__2025
Welcome to my coding journey as part of the #TeachersDayChallenge under the Mission #DrGViswanathan initiative by VIT Bhopal.
This initiative encourages students to practice daily coding, share progress, and grow step-by-step with gratitude towards our mentors. 🌟

## 📅 Daily Coding Log :
This repository will be updated daily with coding problems and solutions that help build core programming skills such as:

Array and string manipulation
Linked list operations
Hashing and searching techniques
Recursion, dynamic programming, and more
📂 Each day will have its own folder (day-1/, day-2/, ...) with clearly written and compiled Java or Python solutions.
