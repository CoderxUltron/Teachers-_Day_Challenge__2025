# Teachers-_Day_Challenge__2025
Welcome to my coding journey as part of the #TeachersDayChallenge under the Mission #DrGViswanathan initiative by VIT Bhopal.
This initiative encourages students to practice daily coding, share progress, and grow step-by-step with gratitude towards our mentors. 🌟

📅 Daily Coding Log
This repository will be updated daily with coding problems and solutions that help build core programming skills such as:

Array and string manipulation
Linked list operations
Hashing and searching techniques
Recursion, dynamic programming, and more
📂 Each day will have its own folder (day-1/, day-2/, ...) with clearly written and compiled Java or Python solutions.

🙌 About the Initiative
The challenge is part of the Mission #DrGViswanathan, initiated by the alumni and supported by the Placement Office of VIT Bhopal.

The goal is to make consistent daily progress—one day, one problem at a time—to sharpen our coding skills and interview readiness.

💻 How I Contribute
⌨️ Code daily: Upload problem solutions in Java or Python on GitHub.
🎥 Practice interviews: (Optional) Solve problems live or record mock interviews for skill improvement.
📢 Share on LinkedIn: Document learning daily or weekly using challenge hashtags.
💙 Gratitude to Mentors
"The dream is big. Your parents’ dream must be achieved. Let’s make it happen. One step at a time."

This challenge is not just about code—it's about commitment, discipline, and gratitude to the teachers and mentors who shape our paths.
